# Nexusmods-wabbajack-autodl-script-for-Autohotkey
This is a simple script activated in autohotkey by the f8 button, you can easily change the key in 15th line of the code . Every two second it searches the screen for the download button, shifts the mouse over it, clicks and then shifts back
Keep in mind this script was made with Wabbajack in mind, mostly because i forgot about people who download trough Vortex (sowwy) But it should still work... mabye idk 
This little shit works Autohoykey, a free, easy and safe software to which the download link you can find here: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

All you need to do is to download the file, place it in a folder. Then in the same folder place two screenshots of the nexus download button, one screenshot needs to be of just the gray download button and the other one needs to be the highlighted button with the mouse over it (of course the screenshot needs to be without the mouse visible).
The second screenshot shouldnt be nessecary as the script moves the mouse back automatically after pressing but I advise it just in case.

"Why won't you just set an autoclicker to click for you every 4 seconds or so?"
Because the slow download button moves up and down depending on the mod description and name and etc, meaning that it would just start clicking a blank space after 10 seconds.

Why did i make this? Because i'm BROKE and i know other people are also BROKE and wont want to pay 10 bucks a month to just install mods

While this script does help with the tedious clicking, the 3mb/s limit still is in place and i'm pretty confident theres no way to bypass it...
Thank you for using my shitty lines of code, if anyone even does. I mostly made it for myself but i can at least try to share the method with others.
:)

Here is a small video showcase on how I use it

sorry if this whole thing reads like gibberish but i am not a native engish speaker i just wanted to share this to possibly help someone too lazy to make their own script 
I also should mention that using autoclickers on nexus is a bannable offense because they're nothing but a bunch of CUNTS! 
cheers
