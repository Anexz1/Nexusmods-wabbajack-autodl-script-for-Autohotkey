# Nexusmods-wabbajack-autodl-script-for-Autohotkey
This is a simple script activated in autohotkey by the f8 button. Every two second it searches the screen for the download button, shifts the mouse over it, clicks and then shifts back

This little shit works Autohoykey, a free, easy and safe software to which the download link you can find here: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

All you need to do is to download the file, place it in a folder. Then in the same folder place two screenshots of the nexus download button, one screenshot needs to be of just the gray download button and the other one needs to be the highlighted button with the mouse over it (of course the screenshot needs to be without the mouse visible).
The second screenshot shouldnt be nessecary as the script moves the mouse back automatically after pressing but I advise it just in case
